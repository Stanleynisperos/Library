# üìö Library Management System with JWT  

Welcome to the **Library Management System**, your ultimate tool for managing books, authors, and users with robust security features. This system is powered by **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to ensure secure and efficient operations. Designed with both administrators and regular users in mind, it simplifies library management while prioritizing safety through token rotation, which guarantees single-use tokens for every operation.  

---  

## üõ†Ô∏è Features  

- **User Registration**: Easy account creation to access the system.  
- **Token-Based Authentication**: Authenticate and gain a unique JWT for secure access.  
- **Token Rotation**: Enhance security with single-use tokens that refresh after every operation.  
- **CRUD Operations**: Perform seamless create, read, update, and delete actions for books, authors, and users.  
  - **Insert**: Add new records for books, authors, or users.  
  - **Update**: Modify existing records to keep information up-to-date.  
  - **Delete**: Remove records with precision and security.  
  - **Retrieve**: Access detailed information about books, authors, and users.
